How do we fight?

	1 small attack: Hammer
	1 super attack x times per level (that you could pimp up): add stun / etc depending

Do we have life?

	Health bar represented as x hearths
	
How do we heal?

	Heal every room/level (maybe)
	Sometimes some enemy can drop health pack (very rare) (drop 1 single hearth)

Inventory: carry one ball at a time. Maybe can not fight when carry it
			-> throw ball to stuns the enemies

UI that shows your previous test??? (option on/off)

	The once that put correctly lits up green to say it's correct
	The wrong ones pop out of the slots
	
	For the steam version: Prunebane: could be multiple options for the puzzle (ordered from easiest to hardest) - 1) slots keep the ball if they are correct. 2) slots could become colored if they are correct [still need to be re-placed]. 3) Door shows mastermind hint "2 correct, 2 wrong", and we don't know which is OK; 3 recent attempts show. 4) as 3], but only last attempt shows.
